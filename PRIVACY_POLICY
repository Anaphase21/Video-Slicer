Video Slicer does not collect any statistics, personal information or analytics from its users. 
The app works with only media files (photo, video and audio). However, it doesn't share any files other
than the ones the user chooses to share with third-party apps from it. 
No information about any media file (either created by the app or other apps) is collected, or stored.
